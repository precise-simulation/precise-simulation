By combining a very _easy-to-use_ graphical user interface (GUI) with _state-of-the-art_ FEA and CFD physics solvers and modeling tools such as FEniCS, Gmsh, OpenFOAM, ParaView, redbKIT, and SU2 enables anyone to use advanced solvers and simulation tools right away, which otherwise would take a days or even weeks to learn how to use. At the same time the FEATool software suite is fully programmable and extensible allowing experienced users to integrate physics models into their own workflows and build simulation apps using MATLAB and Python.
