[<i><b>FEATool Multiphysics</b></i>](https://www.featool.com/)&nbsp; is a fully integrated and _easy-to-use_ mathematical modeling, Partial Differential Equation (PDE), and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) [multi-physics](https://www.featool.com/multiphysics/) simulation platform.

By combining and seamlessly integrating a very _intuitive_ and _easy-to-use_ graphical user interface (GUI) with _state-of-the-art_ finite element analysis (FEA) and fluid dynamics (CFD) physics solvers such as

- [OpenFOAM](https://www.featool.com/Easy-to-Use-OpenFOAM-GUI/)
- [FEniCS](https://www.featool.com/tutorial/2017/06/16/Python-Multiphysics-and-FEA-Simulations-with-FEniCS-and-FEATool/)
- [SU2 Code](https://www.featool.com/doc/su2.html)

as well as CAD geometry, mesh generators (_Gmsh_, _Netgen_, _TetWild_, _Triangle_), and postprocessing and 3D visualization backends (_ParaView_, _Plotly_, _VTK_), enables everyone to _start making multiphysics simulations right away_, without having to spend days or even weeks on learning, compiling, and configuring.

At the same time the _FEATool_ simulation toolbox is _fully programmable_ and _extensible_ allowing experienced users to integrate custom equations and physics models into their own workflows, and also build stand-alone _simulation apps_ using the _Python_ and _Matlab_ scripting languages.
